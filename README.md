# GDM-for-Manipulative-and-Non-cooperative-Behaivor

Group decision making is a problem that includes taking decisions from experts and arriving at a decision that is acceptable to all through a consensus reaching and feedback process. In real world scenerios, some decision makers might manipulate others or might not cooperate in the consensus reaching process, for example, by not updating their preferences to a right extent.

This project implements a model that assumes the data from an interaction network such as whatsapp is given, which allows us to know the interaction frequency of the decision makers. Based on which, the we identify manipulative and non-cooperative behavior and manage it to arrive at an acceptable consensus degree.
